            <p>
                I'm Shravali. Currently, I'm a third year at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.
                I'm pursuing a computer science major. So far, I've loved it at Northeastern.
                On campus, I'm involved with various clubs such as NUWit (Northeastern University Women in Technology), Husky Ambassadors, and
                UTSAV (Northeastern University South Asian Student Organization).

            </p>
            <p>
                In NUWiT every week we hear from business and tech
                leaders around Boston and
                get a chance to network with them. I really enjoy hearing about the experiences of successful and inspirational professionals
                and just learning more about the field of computer science with a group of students that share my excitement.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of Husky Ambassadors I give campus tours where I share my
                Northeastern experience with
                high school students and families and provide more information about the school. When I went on college tours
                as a high school student, the tours played a special role in my understanding and liking of a school and
                I love having the opportunity to guide students through that college decision process.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of UTSAV, I perform Bollywood
                dance in a showcase at the end of the semester with a bunch of my friends in the club. I've been Bollywood dancing
                since I was five years old and love dancing, the music, and the excitement of being on stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not busy with my involvement in clubs, I like to take photos, read, and paint. I recently got into photography, and I
                enjoy wandering around Boston and taking pictures of the beautiful city. When I go back home to New Jersey, I love
                taking pictures of my family, especially my adorable three year old cousin and not as adorable thirteen year
                old brother.
